# Milky

![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/Laiteux/Milky?color=blue) ![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Laiteux/Milky?color=blue)

A library to easily build C# credential stuffing apps.

## Dependencies

- [SocksSharp](https://github.com/Laiteux/SocksSharp)

## Documentation

Not gonna lie, I'm lazy to write one. And to be honest, it probably isn't even needed.

Why isn't it needed? Because of the [examples](examples) folder.

By taking a look at it, you most likely will easily understand how Milky works.

Come on, trust me.
