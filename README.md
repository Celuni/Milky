Milky is a library to easily build C# credential stuffing apps.

In fact, it will manage for you:
- HttpClients creation and distribution (support for backconnect proxies and all protocols using [SocksSharp](https://github.com/Laiteux/SocksSharp))
- Output (directory, whether to output invalids or not, console colors, captures...)
- Console title (hits, free hits, estimated hits, percentages, checked per minute, elapsed/remaining time...)
- Check pause/resume/end functions using hotkeys
- And more... See the code itself or the [examples](https://github.com/Laiteux/Milky/blob/v3/examples) folder for a better overview
