# Milky

A library to easily build C# credential stuffing apps.

## Documentation

Not gonna lie, I'm lazy to write one. And to be honest, it probably isn't even needed.

Why isn't it needed? Because of the [examples](https://github.com/Laiteux/Milky/blob/v3/examples) folder.

By taking a look at it, you most likely will easily understand how Milky works.

Come on, trust me.
